Repository to track my learning of Data Structure and Algorithms.

## Patterns
#### Recursion:
- use recursion to get big solution from small solution eg. fibonacci problem
- use two recursion call in subsequece problem first for take current element and second for not take current element
- when we strike word "combinations" use recursion.
- *subsequence pattern:*
    - print subsequence use parameters
    - In single ans: use true and false to avoid double recursion
    - In cout problem: (return 1 or return 0) and add all functions ans

#### Array
- sometimes we may have to create long array by ourself to solve a problem.
